This project was created following the advice of the book "Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-learn, 
keras & tensorflow" by Aurélien Géron; O'Reilly, as well as practical advice from the Platzi courses from the School of Data Science.

The project contains a notebook with a model to predict the value of real estate listings in California. The main finding is that median house hold income is the best predictor of value.

Evaluating the model showed that precision is not super-high but similar to human estimators of value, which is good enough, and therefore, the model can be used to free valuable time from the human estimators that they can employ in more useful tasks.
